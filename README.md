# cardiovascular-health-improveV2.0

When I was in a local city football club during that days I observed that many beginners are tired easily while running due to following improper techniques of jogging 
and even professional coaches are suggest to atheletes that just maintain your heart beat for long term stamina 
But biggest question is

## Is heart beat is right parameter of stamina?

well my answer is, stamina is mainly related to lungs if we follow the proper breathing technique like steps must be in rythm with the breath
so in this project we just figure out the loop hole in traditional fitness band and fill that loop holes with this rythm technique
